# sub_to_db

*A little code blurb requested of me.*

what it does:
> Access a database and compiles a list of filenames that have previously been entered from a target table.
> Access the target directory compiles a list of filenames that exist in the directory.
> Compare the two list.
> Any of the filenames that dont exist in the database compile a new list.
> Access and insert into target table the filenames from the list of filenames that dont exist.

### A heads up.

This was written as a script for a closed system. So some liberties were taken in some of the sql statement.
